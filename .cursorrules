# Pandemic Deckbuilder - Project Rules

## What This Project Is

A **solo web-based deckbuilder game** inspired by Pandemic mechanics. Players build their deck to treat diseases across cities before toxic waste overwhelms them.

## 📚 Documentation - READ FIRST

All game design and asset documentation lives in `doc/`. **Always consult these before making changes:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `doc/game-design.md` | **Master spec** - Game mechanics, rules, card systems, win/lose conditions |
| `doc/card-art-assets.md` | Card artwork guidelines, SVG structure, color schemes |
| `doc/job-description-*.md` | Agent-specific instructions and responsibilities |

When working on:
- **Game logic** → Read `doc/game-design.md`
- **UI/Cards/Visuals** → Read `doc/card-art-assets.md`
- **Both** → Read both docs first

## 🤖 Agent Job Descriptions

**Every agent working on this project MUST:**

1. **Create a job description document** at `doc/job-description-{role}.md` where `{role}` describes your function (e.g., `game-logic`, `ui-design`, `card-art`)
2. **Read existing job descriptions** to understand what other agents have done
3. **Update your job description** as you work, documenting:
   - What you're responsible for
   - Key decisions you've made
   - Current state of your work
   - Known issues or TODOs
   - Instructions for future agents continuing your work

This creates continuity between sessions and helps agents understand the project context quickly.

## 🎮 Core Game Concepts

1. **Three City Columns** - Mild → Moderate → Critical (left to right)
2. **Scouting** - Hidden cities must be revealed before treating
3. **Treating** - Moves cities LEFT toward cure
4. **Toxic Waste** - Deck pollution from outbreaks (lose condition)
5. **No Cubes** - Column position IS the infection level

## 🎨 Card Power Icons

| Icon | Power | CSS Class |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 💰 | Credit | `.credit` |
| 🩺 | Treat | `.treat` |
| 🔭 | Scout | `.scout` |
| ✨ | Cure | `.cure` |
| ⚡ | Special | `.special` |

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Before Making Changes
1. Check `doc/` for existing specs
2. Maintain consistency with documented mechanics
3. Keep the solo-game focus (no multiplayer)

### Code Style
- Vanilla JS (no frameworks yet)
- CSS custom properties in `:root`
- SVG cards at 180x250 viewBox

### When Adding Features
1. Update `doc/game-design.md` if mechanics change
2. Update `doc/card-art-assets.md` if adding new card types
3. Follow existing card SVG patterns

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a **prototype** - game balance is not finalized
- Many mechanics have **open questions** documented in `doc/game-design.md`
- Card assets use **SVG** format for scalability
- Color scheme: Dark theme with disease colors (red, blue, yellow, black)
